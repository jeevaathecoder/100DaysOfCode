    <h1>📚 Java DSA-Problems Repository</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Java DSA Codes Repository! Here you will find a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java. Additionally, new problem solutions are uploaded daily to help you sharpen your problem-solving skills.</p>

<h2>Folder Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>📁 <strong>src:</strong> Contains the Java source code files With Number Of DAYs.
            <ul>
        <li>📁 <strong>Day Number</strong> Implementations of various data structures.</li>
        <li>📁 <strong>Problem Name</strong> Implementations of different algorithms.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>📁 <strong>problems:</strong> Solutions to new daily problems.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution to a problem you'd like to share, feel free to upload it to the <code>problems</code> directory following the existing format. Make sure your code is well-commented and adheres to best practices.</p>
    <p>If you want to add a new data structure or algorithm implementation, please ensure it is well-tested and documented. Place it in the appropriate directory within the <code>src</code> folder.</p>

 <h2>Daily Problems</h2>
    <p>Every day, a new problem solution will be uploaded to the <code>problems</code> directory. These problems cover a wide range of topics in data structures and algorithms and are designed to help you practice and improve your skills.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns, feel free to reach out to me.</p>

<p>Keep coding passionately! 🚀</p>
